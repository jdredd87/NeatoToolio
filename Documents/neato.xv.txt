DIAGTEST 

DiagTest - Executes different test modes. Once set, press Start button to engage. (Test modes are mutually exclusive.)
    TestsOff - Stop Diagnostic Test and clears all diagnostic test modes. 
    DrivePath - Sets DrivePath TestMode. Press start button to start. Robot travels straight by commanded distance as path. Mutually exclusive with other diagtest modes. Use 'TestsOff' option to stop.
    DriveForever - Sets DriveForever TestMode. Press start button to start. Robot drives continuously. Mutually exclusive with other diagtest modes. Use 'TestsOff' option to stop.
    MoveAndBump - Sets Move and Bump TestMode. Press start button to start. Executes canned series of motions, but will react to bumps. Mutually exclusive with other diagtest modes.
    DropTest - Enables DropTest. Robot drives forward until a drop is detected. Mutually exclusive with other diagtest modes.
    AutoCycle - DropTest argument to enable automatic restart of the test. The robot will drive backwards and then forward until a drop is detected until the test is over.
    OneShot - Only executes test once.
    BrushOn - Turns on brush during test. May conflict with motor commands of test so use carefully!

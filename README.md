# NeatoToolio
Neato Toolio - Diagnostic tool for Neato Botvacs

Slowly adding support for calls for the XV and BotVac Connected / D3-D7 models.

If you just want the executable to run, browse to the win32\debug folder to find it.
Just the one file is needed currently.

Once things are "done" will include an installer.

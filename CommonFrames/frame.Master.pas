{
 Purpose of this "master" frame is simple.
 Contains a timer control ( not every frame may need one.. but it will have at least one available )
 This timer control is registered ( added ) to a common object list ( so can quickly stop all timers )
 Each frame has a "Tab" variable to let the frame know its tab item its stuffed in.
 Create override assings the tab via AOwner. Sets some basic visual properties, and does the timer register.
 This reduces alot of repeated code.

  // this makes sure AOwner IS a TTabItem

  Parent := Tab;
  position.X := 0;
  position.Y := 0;
  align := talignlayout.Client;
  visible := false;
  dmCommon.TimerList.Add(Timer_GetData);
end;

end.
